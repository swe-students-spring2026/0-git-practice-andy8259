## What I found interesting

I found this article interesting because it emphasizes the fact that even 50 years after the NATO Software Engineering Convention, many programmers still don't practice good software engineering. Adam Barr explains the importance of turning programming into an engieering discipline, and that much of the bad code that exists today is because people don't follow this discipline. This is important to me as I *am* a computer science major that hasn't yet learned these engineering principles -- it gives me insight on why these skills, which I'm learning from taking this course, would be important for my career later down the line.

I think this article is particularly interesting because with the concept of vibe coding becoming more and more popular, the idea of writing bad code is becoming a much worse problem because not only are people writing highly inefficient code (a common problem with code written by generative AI), but now people don't even know how to write code anymore. As such, it's becoming more important than ever to be able to write "good" code to stand out from the sea of vibe coders churning out slop.
