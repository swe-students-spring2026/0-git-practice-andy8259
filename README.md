## What I found interesting

I found this article interesting because it emphasizes the fact that even 50 years after the NATO Software Engineering Convention, many programmers still don't practice good software engineering. Adam Barr explains the importance of turning programming into an engieering discipline, and that much of the bad code that exists today is because people don't follow this discipline. This is important to me as I *am* a computer science major that hasn't yet learned these engineering principles -- it gives me insight on why these skills, which I'm learning from taking this course, would be important for my career later down the line.
